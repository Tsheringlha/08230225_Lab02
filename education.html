    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I began my early childhood education at <strong>Loden Foundation</strong> in 2009, where I attended ECCD and developed my foundational skills in learning and social interaction. 
    After that, I continued my studies at <strong>Norbugang Central School</strong> from Pre-Primary up to Class 10, completing a strong foundation in academics and personal growth by 2020. 
    For Class 11, I enrolled at <strong>Tendruk Central School</strong> in 2021, and then completed my Class 12 studies at <strong>Samtse Higher Secondary School</strong> in 2022.</p>
    
    <p>Currently, I am pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Education in Secondary ICT</strong> at <strong>Samtse College of Education</strong> as a third-year student, further developing my knowledge and skills in the field of education and technology. 
    Each stage of my education has shaped me academically and personally, preparing me for my future goals and aspirations.</p>
